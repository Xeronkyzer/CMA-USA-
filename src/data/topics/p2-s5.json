    "overview": "Investment Decisions (10% of Part 2) covers Capital Budgeting: the process of identifying, evaluating, and selecting long-term projects that align with organizational goals and maximize shareholder value. This section is critical for the CMA exam as it tests both conceptual understanding and computational accuracy. The 2026 CMA syllabus emphasizes case-based questions (CBQs) that require integrating capital budgeting techniques with risk analysis and strategic considerations. Mastery requires understanding cash flow identification, discounted cash flow methods, risk assessment techniques, and real options.",

        "**Relevant Cash Flows**: Only Incremental Cash Flows matter. **Include**: Initial Investment, Operating Cash Flows, Working Capital changes, Terminal Value. **Exclude**: Sunk Costs, Allocated Overheads, Financing Costs (interest).",
        "**Depreciation Tax Shield**: Depreciation is non-cash, but it reduces Taxable Income, saving tax. Shield = Annual Depreciation × Tax Rate. This is a critical cash inflow in capital budgeting.",
        "**NPV (Net Present Value)**: PV of Inflows - PV of Outflows. If NPV > 0, Accept. Uses WACC as discount rate. Assumes reinvestment at WACC. Most reliable method for mutually exclusive projects [citation:6].",
        "**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**: Discount rate where NPV = 0. If IRR > Hurdle Rate (WACC), Accept. Assumes reinvestment at IRR (unrealistic assumption) [citation:2]. May give multiple IRRs for non-conventional cash flows.",
        "**Payback Period**: Time to recover initial investment. Simple but ignores TVM and cash flows after payback. Good for liquidity assessment but not profitability [citation:6].",
        "**Discounted Payback**: Payback method that considers TVM by discounting cash flows.",
        "**Profitability Index (PI)**: PV of Future Cash Flows / Initial Investment. If PI > 1, Accept. Useful when capital is rationed.",
        "**Real Options**: Strategic value of managerial flexibility. Project Value = NPV + Option Value [citation:3]. Types: Expand, Abandon, Delay [citation:3].",

        "**Capital Rationing**: Limitation on capital expenditures; choose projects that maximize total NPV subject to budget constraint.",
        "**Tax Considerations**: After-tax cash flows = Pre-tax cash flow × (1 - Tax Rate). Depreciation creates tax shield: Depreciation × Tax Rate."

    "shortNotes": "Understand the NPV vs IRR conflict! NPV is generally superior because it assumes reinvestment at the more realistic WACC (Cost of Capital), whereas IRR assumes reinvestment at the project's own (often high) IRR [citation:2]. For mutually exclusive projects, always pick the one with the highest NPV. Remember that depreciation tax shield is a cash inflow. Ignore sunk costs and financing costs (interest) in cash flow calculations. Real options add value to projects and can turn negative NPV projects into acceptable ones [citation:3].",

For mutually exclusive projects, NPV is the superior decision criterion because it measures the absolute dollar value added to the firm.</p><p><strong>2. Reason for Conflict:</strong><br>The conflict between NPV and IRR typically arises from differences in project size, timing of cash flows, or project lives. In this case, the most likely reason is the difference in <strong>reinvestment rate assumptions</strong> [citation:2][citation:10]. IRR assumes that intermediate cash flows are reinvested at the project's own IRR (18%), while NPV assumes reinvestment at the firm's cost of capital (WACC). Since the IRR is higher than WACC, the IRR method implicitly assumes a higher reinvestment rate, which may not be achievable.</p><p><strong>3. Reinvestment Rate Assumption:</strong><br>The NPV assumption (reinvestment at WACC) is more realistic [citation:2]. The cost of capital represents the firm's opportunity cost of funds and the return available on alternative investments of similar risk.
