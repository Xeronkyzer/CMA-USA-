    "overview": "Financial Statement Analysis (20% of Part 2) is about reading between the numbers. It requires mastery of comparative analysis techniques (horizontal, vertical, common-size), all five ratio categories (Liquidity, Leverage, Activity, Profitability, Market), the DuPont framework, profitability decomposition, and special issues including foreign currency translation, inflation effects, and earnings quality. The CMA exam tests interpretation and judgment — not just formula recall.",
    "bulletNotes": [
        "**Horizontal Analysis**: Year-over-year % change. Base year = denominator. Identifies trends.",
        "**Vertical Analysis (Common-Size)**: Each line as % of total (BS: Total Assets; IS: Net Sales). Enables cross-company comparison.",
        "**Liquidity**: Current Ratio (CA/CL), Quick Ratio ((Cash+Mkt Sec+AR)/CL), Cash Ratio (Cash/CL). Higher = more liquid.",
        "**Leverage**: Debt-to-Equity (Total Debt/Equity), Debt-to-Assets (Total Debt/Total Assets), TIE (EBIT/Interest).",
        "**Activity**: Inventory Turnover (COGS/Avg Inv), AR Turnover (Credit Sales/Avg AR), AP Turnover (COGS/Avg AP). Days = 365/Turnover.",
        "**CCC**: Days Inventory + DSO – DPO. Lower is better. Negative CCC = suppliers finance operations.",
        "**Profitability**: Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, EBITDA Margin, ROA, ROE.",
        "**DuPont (3-factor)**: ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier.",
        "**FX Translation**: Current Rate Method (independent sub) → OCI. Temporal Method (integrated sub) → Net Income.",
        "**Earnings Quality**: High quality = recurring, cash-backed, conservative accounting. Watch for one-time gains."
    ],
    "shortNotes": "Always use AVERAGE balance sheet figures when mixing with income statement data (ROA, Turnover ratios). DuPont is the #1 tested framework — know all three components and what drives each. For FX: Current Rate = OCI; Temporal = Net Income.
