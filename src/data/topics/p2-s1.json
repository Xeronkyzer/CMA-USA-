    "overview": "Financial Statement Analysis (20% of Part 2) is about reading between the numbers. It requires mastery of comparative analysis techniques (horizontal, vertical, common-size), all five ratio categories (Liquidity, Leverage, Activity, Profitability, Market), the DuPont framework, profitability decomposition, and special issues including foreign currency translation, inflation effects, and earnings quality. The CMA exam tests interpretation and judgment — not just formula recall. You must be able to analyze trends, identify red flags, evaluate performance against benchmarks, and understand how accounting choices affect ratios. This section bridges raw financial data with strategic business decisions.",
    "bulletNotes": [
        "**Horizontal Analysis (Trend)**: (Current Year – Base Year) / Base Year × 100%. Base year is denominator. Identifies growth patterns and turning points.",
        "**Vertical Analysis (Common-Size)**: Each line as % of base (IS: Net Sales; BS: Total Assets). Enables size-independent comparisons across companies and periods.",
        "**Liquidity Ratios – Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt**: Current Ratio (CA/CL) ≥2; Quick Ratio (excludes inventory) ≥1; Cash Ratio (most conservative). Watch for excess inventory inflating Current Ratio.",
        "**Leverage Ratios – Long-Term Solvency Risk**: Debt-to-Equity (TD/TE) – higher = more risk; Times Interest Earned (EBIT/Interest) – <1 means can't cover interest; Equity Multiplier (Assets/Equity) – DuPont component.",
        "**Activity Ratios – Efficiency**: Inventory Turnover (COGS/Avg Inv); AR Turnover (Credit Sales/Avg AR); AP Turnover (COGS/Avg AP); Asset Turnover (Sales/Avg Assets). Always use AVERAGE balances.",
        "**Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**: Days Inventory + DSO – DPO. Lower is better. Negative CCC = suppliers finance operations (retailers).",
        "**Profitability Ratios**: Gross Margin (GP/Sales); Operating Margin (EBIT/Sales); Net Margin (NI/Sales); ROA (NI/Avg Assets); ROE (NI/Avg Equity). Compare to industry benchmarks.",
        "**DuPont (3-factor)**: ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier. Decomposes ROE into profitability, efficiency, and leverage. #1 tested framework.",
        "**Market Ratios**: P/E (Price/EPS) – growth expectations; Dividend Yield (DPS/Price) – income return; Dividend Payout (DPS/EPS) – % of earnings paid out.",
        "**Basic vs Diluted EPS**: Diluted ≤ Basic. Diluted includes options, convertibles, contingently issuable shares.",
        "**FX Translation – Critical Difference**: Current Rate Method (independent sub, functional currency = local) → Translation adjustment to OCI. Temporal Method (integrated sub, functional currency = parent) → Remeasurement gain/loss to Net Income. Memory: Current = Cushioned (OCI), Temporal = Tough (hits Income).",
        "**Monetary vs Non-Monetary**: Monetary = fixed dollar amount (Cash, AR, AP, Debt) – translated at current rate under Temporal. Non-monetary = Inventory, PPE, Prepaids – translated at historical rate under Temporal.",
        "**Earnings Quality Indicators – High Quality**: Recurring (core operations), Cash-backed (CFO ≈ NI), Conservative accounting, Consistent policies.",
        "**Earnings Quality Red Flags**: NI >> CFO (accruals not converting); Frequent accounting changes; Large one-time gains; Channel stuffing; Capitalizing expenses; Aggressive revenue recognition.",
        "**Inflation Effects**: Distorts historical cost – FIFO overstates real profit; Depreciation understated; Real profitability lower than reported.",
        "**No.1 Exam Trap**: Using year-end balances instead of AVERAGES for ratios mixing IS (flow) and BS (point) data (ROA, Turnover ratios).",
        "**DuPont Insight**: ROE can increase due to higher leverage even when business is deteriorating – always analyze components.",
        "**DSO Interpretation**: Lower DSO = faster collection = better. Higher DSO may indicate collection problems or liberal credit terms."

    "shortNotes": "Always use AVERAGE balance sheet figures when mixing with income statement data (ROA, Turnover ratios). DuPont is the #1 tested framework — know all three components and what drives each. For FX: Current Rate = OCI; Temporal = Net Income. Earnings quality questions require judgment about sustainability of reported earnings. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) measures operating efficiency – lower is better. Remember that ROE can be inflated by leverage – always check DuPont components. Watch for red flags: NI > CFO, inventory growing faster than sales, DSO increasing.",
