    "overview": "Risk Management (10% of Part 2) covers Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) using the COSO 2017 framework. This section focuses on integrating risk with strategy and performance to create, preserve, and realize value. The 2026 CMA syllabus emphasizes understanding the five components of ERM (GOPRO), distinguishing between inherent and residual risk, and applying appropriate risk responses in various business scenarios. Mastery of this section requires memorizing the framework components and principles, understanding risk terminology, and applying risk response strategies to real-world situations. Unlike other sections, Risk Management is more conceptual than computational, but the CMA exam tests application through scenario-based questions requiring identification of correct risk components, responses, and terminology.",

In pursuing value, entities face uncertainty (risk). Management must decide how much uncertainty to accept as it strives to grow stakeholder value [citation:6].</p><p><strong>Risk Definition (COSO):</strong> The possibility that events will occur and affect the achievement of strategy and business objectives [citation:6].</p><h3>Value Framework (CPER)</h3><p>Risk management affects value in four ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Creation:</strong> When the benefits of an activity exceed the cost of resources used.</li><li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Ongoing operations sustain the created benefits over time.</li><li><strong>Erosion:</strong> Faulty strategy, poor execution, or unexpected events cause value to decline.</li><li><strong>Realization:</strong> Benefits are ultimately received by stakeholders (shareholders, employees, customers).</li></ul><p><strong>Mission, Vision, Core Values:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Mission:</strong> Core purpose – why the company exists.</li><li><strong>Vision:</strong> Aspirations – what the company hopes to achieve in the future.</li><li><strong>Core Values:</strong> Organization's beliefs and principles – how the company will achieve its vision.</li></ul><p>These three elements guide risk appetite and strategy formulation.</p>"

    "summary": "Risk Management (10% of Part 2) is based on the COSO ERM 2017 framework, which integrates risk with strategy and performance to create, preserve, and realize value. The five components (GOPRO) are Governance & Culture (DOVES), Strategy & Objective-Setting (SOAR), Performance (VAPIR), Review & Revision (SIR), and Information, Communication & Reporting (TIP). Key terminology: Risk Appetite (willing to accept), Risk Capacity (can absorb), Risk Tolerance (acceptable variation), Inherent Risk (before controls), Residual Risk (after controls). Risk responses include Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept, and Pursue. Risk assessment can be qualitative (heat maps) or quantitative (expected loss, VaR). The portfolio view considers risk correlations. ERM differs from Internal Control – ERM is broader, strategic, and focused on value, while Internal Control is tactical and focused on controls. The CMA exam tests application through scenarios requiring identification of components, responses, and terminology. Remember that risk is not inherently bad – managing risk optimally creates value.",

ERM vs Internal Control:</strong><br>Internal Control (COSO 2013, often remembered by the mnemonic CRIME) is tactical, focusing on controls to ensure accurate financial reporting, operational efficiency, and compliance. It is primarily backward-looking and focused on prevention and detection [citation:2].</p><p>ERM (COSO 2017, GOPRO) is strategic and forward-looking. It focuses on value creation and preservation, managing uncertainty to help the organization achieve its performance and strategic goals. ERM integrates risk considerations into strategy setting, while internal controls are one tool within the broader ERM framework [citation:1][citation:5][citation:6].</p><p><strong>2. Strategy Integration Benefits:</strong><br>By integrating ERM with Strategy, the organization can:<br>• Align Risk Appetite with strategic goals – ensuring the chosen strategy doesn't expose the company to risks it cannot handle [citation:8].<br>• Evaluate alternative strategies based on risk profiles – choosing strategies with optimal risk-return trade-offs [citation:2][citation:8].<br>• Identify opportunities as well as risks – positive events can feed back into strategy formulation [citation:6].<br>• Ensure the company is taking <em>enough</em> risk to achieve desired returns (optimization, not minimization) [citation:6].<br>• Develop a portfolio view of risk, understanding how risks correlate and offset across the entity [citation:2][citation:8].</p><p>ERM transforms risk management from a defensive, compliance-focused activity into a strategic tool for value creation and realization (CPER: Creation, Preservation, Erosion, Realization) [citation:2][citation:6].</p>"
