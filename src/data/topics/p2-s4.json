Strategy Integration Benefits:</strong><br>By integrating ERM with Strategy, the organization can:<br>• Align Risk Appetite with strategic goals – ensuring the chosen strategy doesn't expose the company to risks it cannot handle [citation:8].<br>• Evaluate alternative strategies based on risk profiles – choosing strategies with optimal risk-return trade-offs [citation:2][citation:8].<br>• Identify opportunities as well as risks – positive events can feed back into strategy formulation [citation:6].<br>• Ensure the company is taking <em>enough</em> risk to achieve desired returns (optimization, not minimization) [citation:6].<br>• Develop a portfolio view of risk, understanding how risks correlate and offset across the entity [citation:2][citation:8].</p><p>ERM transforms risk management from a defensive, compliance-focused activity into a strategic tool for value creation and realization (CPER: Creation, Preservation, Erosion, Realization) [citation:2][citation:6].</p>"
