    "overview": "Cost Management (15%) is about accurately measuring and managing the costs of resources, processes, and products. This section covers the full lifecycle: from Cost Concepts (Behavior, Objects, Drivers) to Cost Accumulation Systems (Job Order, Process Costing, Activity-Based Costing), Overhead Management (Allocation Methods, Capacity Levels, Service Department Cost Allocation), and Strategic Improvement Frameworks (Lean Manufacturing, Theory of Constraints, Value Chain Analysis, Business Process Improvement). Success requires mastering both the calculation of product costs under different methods and the strategic analysis of cost data to drive efficiency, eliminate waste, and support decision-making. The CMA exam tests both technical proficiency and the ability to interpret cost information for managerial action.",
    "bulletNotes": [
        "**Cost Behavior**: Variable (Total varies, Unit constant), Fixed (Total constant, Unit varies), Mixed (Separate using High-Low or Regression), Step (Constant within ranges, then jumps).",
        "**Costing Methods**: **Actual** (All actual costs), **Normal** (Actual DM/DL + Budgeted OH Rate), **Standard** (All predetermined standards).",
        "**Absorption vs Variable Costing**: The income difference equals Change in Inventory Units × Fixed Overhead per Unit. When Production > Sales, Absorption Income is Higher.",
        "**Process Costing**: **Weighted Average** blends beginning and current costs; **FIFO** separates beginning inventory costs. EUP calculation is critical.",
        "**Service Department Allocation**: **Direct** (ignores inter-service), **Step-Down** (one-way recognition), **Reciprocal** (fully recognizes mutual services using simultaneous equations).",
        "**Capacity Levels**: **Theoretical** (ideal, unattainable), **Practical** (realistic, includes downtime), **Normal** (long-term average demand), **Master Budget** (next year's expected activity).",
        "**ABC Hierarchy**: Unit-Level, Batch-Level, Product-Level, Facility-Level costs. ABC fixes product cost cross-subsidization.",
        "**Joint Products**: Allocation methods include Physical Measure, Sales Value at Split-off, and NRV. Process further only if incremental revenue > incremental cost.",
        "**Supply Chain & BPI**: **Lean** (Pull/JIT, Waste elimination), **TOC** (Bottleneck management, Throughput = Sales – DM), **Value Chain** (R&D to Service), **ABM** (Strategic use of ABC data), **BPR** (Radical redesign).",
        "**Spoilage**: **Normal** (inherent in process) is a product cost; **Abnormal** (avoidable) is a period loss.",
        "**Backflush Costing**: Used in JIT; delays cost recording until production completion or sale."
    ],
    "shortNotes": "Focus on understanding cost behavior and the flow of costs through different systems. Master the difference between Absorption and Variable costing—it's a guaranteed exam topic. For Process Costing, practice EUP calculations under both Weighted Average and FIFO until they become automatic. Understand why capacity choice matters for overhead rates and pricing decisions. For strategic topics, know the key principles of Lean, TOC, and ABC without getting lost in operational details. Remember: Cost Management is about providing useful information for decisions, not just precise calculations.",

These are also called overhead.</li></ul><p><strong>Cost Behavior Patterns:</strong> How costs respond to changes in activity level.</p><ul><li><strong>Variable Costs:</strong> Change in total in direct proportion to changes in activity. Per-unit cost remains constant. Examples: Direct materials, sales commissions, piece-rate labor.</li><li><strong>Fixed Costs:</strong> Remain constant in total within the relevant range. Per-unit cost varies inversely with activity. Examples: Rent, salaries, insurance.</li><li><strong>Mixed Costs (Semivariable):</strong> Contain both fixed and variable components. Formula: <code>y = a + bx</code> where a = fixed cost, b = variable rate, x = activity. Examples: Utilities (fixed base + usage charge), phone bills.</li><li><strong>Step Costs:</strong> Constant for a range of activity, then increase to a new level. Examples: Adding a supervisor when headcount exceeds 20, adding a new production line.</li></ul><h3>Separating Mixed Costs</h3><ul><li><strong>High-Low Method:</strong> Uses highest and lowest activity points. Variable rate = (Cost at high activity – Cost at low activity) / (High activity – Low activity). Fixed cost = Total cost at high activity – (Variable rate × High activity). Simple but sensitive to outliers.</li><li><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong> Statistical method using all data points. Provides R² (goodness of fit) and standard error. More accurate than high-low.</li></ul><h3>Cost Measurement Systems (Timing of Cost Recording)</h3><ul><li><strong>Actual Costing:</strong> Uses actual DM, actual DL, and actual OH. OH can only be determined at period end; not useful for timely pricing or decisions.</li><li><strong>Normal Costing:</strong> Uses actual DM, actual DL, and <strong>allocated OH</strong> using a predetermined rate (Budgeted OH / Budgeted activity). Most common for internal and external reporting during the year.</li><li><strong>Standard Costing:</strong> Uses predetermined standards for all costs (DM, DL, OH). Variances highlight inefficiencies. Best for control and performance evaluation.</li></ul>"

It completely ignores any services provided by one service department to another (e.g., IT support given to HR). It is simplest but least accurate.</p><p><strong>2. Reciprocal Method:</strong><br>Allocates costs by recognizing <em>all</em> mutual services between support departments using simultaneous equations. It reflects the full cost of support.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>The Reciprocal Method is more accurate because it captures the true consumption of resources across the entire organization, whereas the Direct Method may understate the cost of service departments that heavily utilize other support functions.</p>"
