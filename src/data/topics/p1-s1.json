    "overview": "External Financial Reporting Decisions (15%) forms the technical accounting backbone of Part 1. This section requires mastery of financial statement structure, recognition and measurement principles under US GAAP (including consolidated financial statements), analytical interpretation of reporting choices, and understanding of key differences between US GAAP and IFRS. The CMA exam emphasizes application — candidates must evaluate how accounting decisions affect earnings, cash flows, ratios, and long-term business decisions.",
    "bulletNotes": [
        "Financial statements are fully interconnected — one transaction often affects multiple statements.",
        "Net income is not the same as cash flow.",
        "The indirect method of cash flows is heavily tested.",
        "Inventory valuation impacts profitability, liquidity, and taxes.",
        "Impairment testing differs significantly between GAAP and IFRS.",
        "Revenue recognition timing affects earnings quality.",
        "Deferred taxes arise from temporary (timing) differences only.",
        "Lease accounting increases reported leverage under ASC 842.",
        "Consolidated FS: Eliminate intercompany transactions. VIE = Risk/Reward model. Voting Interest = >50% ownership.",
        "LIFO is prohibited under IFRS.",
        "Goodwill is not amortized, but tested annually for impairment.",
        "The equity method: dividends reduce the investment account, not income.",
        "For GAAP impairment of assets held for use, step 1 uses undiscounted cash flows."
    ],
    "shortNotes": "Begin with structural clarity: understand how each statement is built. Then focus on measurement rules (historical cost, amortized cost, fair value, NRV). Finally, connect accounting choices to financial ratios and performance evaluation. CMA questions frequently require tracing transaction impact across income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Master the indirect method adjustments and intercompany eliminations. Pay special attention to the new consolidation topic (VIE vs. voting interest) and the 5-step revenue model.",
