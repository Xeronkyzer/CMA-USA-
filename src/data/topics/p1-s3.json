    "overview": "Performance Management (20% of Part 1) is not just calculation—it is diagnostic analysis. It answers: Did we perform as expected? If not, why? Who is responsible? What behavior will this measurement system encourage? It covers the full spectrum from Variance Analysis (Static vs Flexible budgets, Mix/Yield, Sales variances) to Responsibility Accounting (ROI, RI, EVA, Transfer Pricing) and non-financial measures (Balanced Scorecard, Cost of Quality). The goal is to align behavior with strategy, prevent suboptimization, ensure long-term value creation, and understand the trade-offs between different performance metrics.",

For transfer pricing, always consider opportunity cost based on capacity utilization.

Who is responsible for the deviation? What behavior will this measurement system encourage?\" It is fundamentally about control, feedback, and continuous improvement.</p><h3>Static vs Flexible Budget (The Foundation)</h3><p><strong>Static Budget (Master Budget):</strong> Prepared at the beginning of the period based on <em>planned</em> output. It does NOT adjust for actual activity levels. Used for planning and initial resource allocation.</p><p><strong>Flexible Budget:</strong> A budget that adjusts to the <em>actual</em> output level using standard costs per unit. It answers: \"What should our costs have been for the actual volume we achieved?\" Used for <em>performance evaluation</em>.</p><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> If actual sales volume increases, total variable costs naturally increase. Comparing actual costs to the original static budget would incorrectly suggest overspending. We must compare Actual Results to the <strong>Flexible Budget</strong> to isolate efficiency and price effects from volume effects.</p><p><strong>The Three-Budget Framework:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Static Budget:</strong> Based on planned volume.</li><li><strong>Flexible Budget:</strong> Based on actual volume using standard costs.</li><li><strong>Actual Results:</strong> Real results achieved.</li></ol>"

It measures the return generated per dollar of investment.</p><p><strong>2. Dysfunctional Behaviors:</strong><br><ul><li><strong>Underinvestment (Suboptimization):</strong> A manager with a high current ROI (e.g., 20%) may reject a profitable project yielding 15% (above the company's 10% cost of capital) because it would mathematically lower their average 20% ROI. This hurts the company's total value.</li><li><strong>Short-Termism:</strong> Managers may cut R&D, maintenance, or training costs to boost the numerator (Income) or delay asset purchases to reduce the denominator (Invested Capital), harming long-term viability.</li></ul></p><p><strong>3. Alternative Metric:</strong> <strong>Residual Income (RI)</strong> or <strong>EVA</strong>. RI = Income - (Capital × Cost of Capital). Since RI measures absolute dollar value added, the manager in the example above would accept the 15% project because it generates positive RI, aligning personal incentives with company shareholders.</p>"
