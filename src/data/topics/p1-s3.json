It covers the full spectrum from Variance Analysis (Static vs. Flexible budgets, Mix/Yield) to Responsibility Accounting (ROI, RI, EVA, Transfer Pricing) and non-financial measures (Balanced Scorecard, COQ). The goal is to align behavior with strategy, prevent suboptimization, and ensure long-term value creation.",
