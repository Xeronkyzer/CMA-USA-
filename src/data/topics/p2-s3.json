    "overview": "Decision Analysis (25% of Part 2) is the most heavily weighted section, critical for passing the CMA exam. It focuses on using financial data to make short-term profitability decisions. Mastery of CVP Analysis, Relevant Costing (Marginal Analysis), and Pricing Methodologies is non-negotiable. The 2026 syllabus emphasizes case-based questions (CBQs) that simulate real-world scenarios requiring both quantitative analysis and qualitative judgment. This guide incorporates the latest exam trends, common traps, and integration with other Part 2 topics.",

For target profit after tax, always gross up: Pre-tax = After-tax/(1 - tax rate). When capacity is constrained, think in terms of contribution per unit of constraint.",
