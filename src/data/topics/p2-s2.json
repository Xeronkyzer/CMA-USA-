    "overview": "Corporate Finance (20% of Part 2) focuses on maximizing shareholder value through long-term investment financing (Capital Structure), short-term liquidity management (Working Capital), and risk management. Mastery of WACC, CAPM, Working Capital metrics, and International Finance instruments is essential. The CMA exam tests not just formula recall but the ability to evaluate trade-offs: risk vs return, debt vs equity, aggressive vs conservative working capital policies, and hedging strategies. You must be able to calculate the cost of capital, analyze leverage impacts, optimize inventory levels, and recommend appropriate financing or hedging instruments in scenario-based questions.",

        "**Risk & Return Fundamental**: Higher risk requires higher expected return. This is the core principle of finance.",

        "**Cost of Equity Methods**: CAPM, Dividend Discount Model (Ke = D1/P0 + g), and Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium.",
        "**Yield Curve Shapes**: Normal (upward) = economic expansion expected; Inverted (downward) = recession predicted; Flat = transition/uncertainty.",

        "**Dividend Dates**: Declaration (liability created), Ex-dividend (stock trades without dividend – price drops), Record (identify holders), Payment (cash sent).",
        "**Working Capital Policies**: Aggressive = low current assets, high short-term debt → higher risk/return. Conservative = high current assets, low short-term debt → lower risk/return.",
        "**Cash Management Motives**: Transactional (daily ops), Precautionary (emergencies), Speculative (opportunistic investments).",
        "**Float**: Difference between bank balance and book balance. Mail float, processing float, clearing float. Lockbox systems reduce float.",

    "shortNotes": "WACC is the most critical calculation. Always tax-adjust the Cost of Debt: Kd × (1 – t). For Working Capital, know the trade-off: holding more assets (cash/inventory) lowers risk but hurts profitability (ROA). In International Finance, 'Translation' is accounting (OCI), 'Transaction' is cash flow risk. CAPM links risk and return – beta measures systematic risk only. EMH levels: weak (technical analysis useless), semi-strong (fundamental analysis useless), strong (insider trading useless). EOQ balances ordering and carrying costs. Derivatives: forwards (custom/OTC), futures (standardized/exchange), options (rights/premium), swaps (exchanges). Leverage amplifies returns AND risk – DOL, DFL, DTL measure this amplification.

For working capital, master EOQ, reorder point, cost of trade credit, and cash management tools (lockbox, float). Know the differences between aggressive and conservative policies. For restructuring, distinguish spin-off (no cash) from carve-out (cash) and know takeover defenses. In international finance, differentiate transaction, translation, and economic exposure, and match hedging instruments to each.
