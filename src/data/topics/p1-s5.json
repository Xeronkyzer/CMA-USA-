Questions are heavily scenario-based. You must be able to identify control weaknesses, classify control types, determine affected COSO components, evaluate segregation of duties issues, compute risk metrics (EMV, Value of Control), and recognize regulatory violations. This is NOT a memorization section — it tests judgment and application.",
