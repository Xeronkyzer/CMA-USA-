    "overview": "Internal Controls (15%) covers the COSO 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework, Corporate Governance structures, Internal Auditing, Risk Management, IT/Systems Controls, and the legal frameworks of FCPA and SOX. Questions are heavily scenario-based. You must be able to identify control weaknesses, classify control types, determine affected COSO components, evaluate segregation of duties issues, compute risk metrics (EMV, Value of Control), and recognize regulatory violations. This is NOT a memorization section — it tests judgment and application. Success requires the ability to analyze real-world scenarios, identify control gaps, recommend improvements, and understand the legal and governance context in which controls operate.",

    "shortNotes": "Master the COSO cube: 3 Objectives (ORC) × 5 Components (CRIME) × 17 Principles. For exam scenarios, first identify which objective is threatened (Operations, Reporting, or Compliance). Then determine which COSO component is weak. Check segregation of duties (ARC). Classify the control type. Apply risk formulas (EMV, Value of Control). Know the legal requirements: FCPA applies to all SEC registrants (not just international), SOX Sections 302 (certification), 404 (assessment), 806 (whistleblower).

This is the primary focus area for SOX Section 404.</li><li><strong>Compliance (C):</strong> Adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and internal policies.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Internal controls provide <strong>reasonable assurance</strong>, NOT absolute assurance. No control system can guarantee zero misstatements or fraud due to inherent limitations (see Section 11).</p><h3>The COSO Cube</h3><p>The framework is often visualized as a cube showing the relationship between Objectives (vertical), Components (horizontal), and the Entity/Units/Activities (third dimension).
