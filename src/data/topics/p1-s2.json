    "overview": "This section represents 20% of the Part 1 exam and is the bridge between strategy and execution. It covers the entire planning cycle: from high-level strategic analysis (SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces) to the granular details of the Master Budget. Candidates must master forecasting techniques (regression, learning curves), budget methodologies (standard, flexible, zero-based, activity-based), and the complete sequence of operational and financial budgets. Success requires the ability to calculate variances, prepare pro forma financial statements, and evaluate the behavioral impact of budgeting choices.",
    "bulletNotes": [
        "Strategic planning (5-10 years) sets the mission; budgeting (1 year) operationalizes it.",
        "SWOT Analysis evaluates Internal factors (Strengths, Weaknesses) and External factors (Opportunities, Threats).",
        "Porter's 5 Forces analyzes industry competitiveness and long-term profitability limits.",
        "The Master Budget always begins with the Sales Budget (constrained by demand/capacity).",
        "Production Budget = Sales + Desired Ending Inv. - Beginning Inv.",
        "Regression analysis (y = a + bx) separates mixed costs into fixed (a) and variable (b) components.",
        "R-squared (coefficient of determination) measures the reliability of the regression line (closer to 1 is better).",
        "Learning Curve: doubling cumulative output reduces average time per unit by a constant percentage.",
        "Expected Value is the weighted average of possible outcomes (Sum of Outcome x Probability).",
        "Cash Budget excludes non-cash items like depreciation and bad debt expense (unless using direct write-off).",
        "Flexible budgets adjust the static budget for the ACTUAL level of activity to measure efficiency.",
        "Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) requires justifying every dollar from scratch, not just increments."
    ],
    "shortNotes": "Focus on the logical flow: Strategy -> Forecast -> Master Budget. Memorize the 'Production Budget' formula—it's the key that unlocks Materials and Labor budgets. For forecasting, master simple regression interpretation and the high-low method. Understand that flexible budgets are the only fair way to evaluate performance. Be ready to calculate cash collections and disbursements, as liquidity questions are frequent.",
