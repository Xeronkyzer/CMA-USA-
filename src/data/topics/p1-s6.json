    "overview": "Technology and Analytics (15%) covers how modern information systems, data governance, emerging technologies, and data analytics transform the management accountant's role. You must understand ERP systems, the Data Life Cycle, security controls, SDLC, process automation (RPA vs AI), blockchain, and the four levels of analytics (Descriptive → Diagnostic → Predictive → Prescriptive). This section also tests Big Data concepts, data visualization best practices, business intelligence tools, and regression analysis (Simple, Multiple, and Logistic). Questions are application-based — expect scenarios where you must select the correct analytics type, identify the right visualization, evaluate technology adoption decisions, or interpret statistical outputs.",

(Yes/No)</li><li>Loan application approved? (Approved/Rejected)</li><li>Product passes quality inspection? (Pass/Fail)</li><li>Employee will leave within year?

Inputs: credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio. Output: probability of default. If probability > 0.3 (bank's chosen threshold), loan is denied.</p><p><strong>CMA Exam Focus for Logistic Regression:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Recognize when logistic regression is appropriate</strong> (binary outcome question).</li><li><strong>Understand that output is a probability</strong>, not a continuous value.</li><li><strong>Distinguish from linear regression</strong> – if question asks for Yes/No, Pass/Fail, Approve/Reject, it's logistic.</li><li>Know that logistic regression is used in credit scoring, fraud detection, quality control pass/fail, and employee turnover prediction.</li></ul>"
